# IOT_project
The RFID Based Attendance System is technologically advanced and is purposely designed to resolve the issue of errors and inefficiency in manual attendance. 
The project system runs by the process of getting the unique code from the card to compare with the database in the XAMPP Control Panel and mark the arrival and departure time of that user. 
Its Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed using PHP to make the database easier to access. 
For the hardware NodeMCU ESP8266 development board with MF-RC522 Module is used to send the card UID to the PHP Web app and store data into the database. 
The project will help the lecturers and companies maintain an automatic record of the attendance of their students and employees. It helps in the smooth running of schools, 
colleges, offices, and industries.
